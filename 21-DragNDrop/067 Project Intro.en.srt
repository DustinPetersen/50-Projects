00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,250
All right, so in this project, I want to get into a little bit of drag and drop functionality, so

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,340
we're going to just create these boxes style, these boxes.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,280
We're going to have one div inside one of these boxes that has a background image coming from one splash,

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,390
just a random image.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,870
And you see, if I grab it, a couple of things happen.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,750
The the image I'm holding has a class of hold, which gives it a gray border, which you can't really

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,020
see.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,030
It's very faint, but it has a border.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:34,770
And then each one of these boxes I hover over gets a class of Harvard, which gets a back of a background,

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,580
a dark background and a white dashboard.

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,770
And then if I drop, it'll actually go in whichever of these hovering over.

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,170
All right.

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,670
So it's a very simple project, but it gives you a basic understanding of how drag and drop works.

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,150
And you can then go on to build some really cool interfaces or even games and stuff like that.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,400
So let's go ahead and jump in and get started.
