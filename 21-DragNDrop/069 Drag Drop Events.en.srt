1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,800
OK, so now we want to fire off specific events at certain times during the whole drag process, so

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,300
first thing I want to do is create our drag functions.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,570
I'm going to do that down here.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,220
So the first one is drag start, and that does exactly what it says.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,400
As soon as you pick something up and he starts to drag it, this will fire off.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,180
And for now, I'm just going to do a console log for all of these and just say what they do.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,490
So that's drag start.

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,070
And then I guess we'll just you we'll just copy this down a few times.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,170
So we have drag start.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,520
We also have drag end.

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,860
And you can check out these events in the Murdochs, too, but you'll see exactly when they fire off

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,610
the drag and we have drag over.

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,360
So when we drag over something, drag enter

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:01,850
and drag leave so we can enter and leave and we also have drag drop for when we drop.

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,210
All right.

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,900
And then we'll just change the this text here say drag drop.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,730
This one is leave.

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:19,110
This one is enter and this one over and end.

19
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:19,810
All right.

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,600
So when do we want to fire these off while we need to bring in.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:34,550
Or, you know what, we need to drag, which is the film class, and then all of these empty boxes,

22
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,750
which there's multiple of.

23
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:35,990
Right.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,270
So we need to use query, select, they're all for those.

25
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:47,630
So let's first grab our fill, which is only one of so we'll say document dot, query selector, and

26
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,240
that has a class of fill.

27
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,100
And then we also want all the class of empty as more than one.

28
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,520
So we want to do query selector all.

29
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,680
We'll call this MTIs and let's do four fill.

30
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:09,230
We have to two events that we want to fire off and two of these functions drag's start in drag end.

31
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,390
So that applies to the fill to this image that I'm actually dragging.

32
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,980
So let's add an event listener on to this.

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
And I named the functions the same as the events.

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,450
Only the events are all lowercase.

35
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,260
So you want to do drag, start all lowercase.

36
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,310
That's the event name.

37
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:31,820
And then we're going to fall call drag star like that and we're going to do the same with drag.

38
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:38,420
And so make sure the second one has the camel case because that's the function and this is going to

39
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,370
be drag and all lowercase.

40
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:41,690
All right.

41
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,020
So let's go ahead and open up the console here.

42
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,500
I'm going to put this at the bottom.

43
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:58,360
And this kind of messes up the sizing of this, but I don't know, that's fine, I guess, because it'll

44
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,550
still pop in there.

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,380
So I'm going to click this and notice as soon as I pick it up, we get dragster.

46
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,600
And then when I let go, I get drag and drag, start drag.

47
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,850
And so we know that that's firing off.

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,300
So we know these functions are running.

49
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:22,130
Now, the rest of the functions here are going to go on the empty boxes.

50
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,020
All right.

51
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,460
So I'm going to there's a couple of ways we could do this.

52
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,510
We could use foreach we've been doing that quite a bit throughout the course.

53
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,260
So we're going to use a for loop here that we can do this as well.

54
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,960
And we'll say for const empty of empty.

55
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,450
So this is a form of loop the slot.

56
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,590
This should be MTIs because remember this is a node list which is basically an array.

57
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,970
And we're just saying for each empty of the MTIs array, then what we want to do, we want to use that

58
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,370
empty variable and we want to add an event listener.

59
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,850
So this is going to be for drag over and that's going to call the function drag over.

60
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,820
And we want four of these.

61
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:16,570
So this next one here is going to be drag, enter, drag, enter.

62
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,780
We have drag leave, drag leave.

63
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,720
Now, the last one is is a little different than the rest because all the other events start with drag.

64
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,030
This one is just drop.

65
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,070
So we don't want drag drop here.

66
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,060
We just want drop.

67
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,380
But I did call the function drag drop so they drag drop.

68
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:39,970
All right.

69
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,280
So now let's save that and I'm going to grab this.

70
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,570
You can see drag over is just keeps firing off.

71
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,030
And as long as we're moving over something, it just keeps firing off.

72
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,370
And you can see drag enter, drag leave.

73
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,950
OK, so so enter and leave just will run once like you enter when we enter this box here and then when

74
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:07,440
I leave it calls drag leave, but when I'm going anywhere over it, it calls drag over.

75
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,570
So hopefully you can see what exactly what the when these events are firing off.

76
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:20,580
Now, as far as these events down here, we'll start with Drag's Star, which is on the the Phil element.

77
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:20,860
Right.

78
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,580
It's on this right here, which is the as the has the background image.

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,810
So what I want to do with that first is add the class name of hold.

80
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,990
So I'm going to say this class name and this we can just assign a class or we can append a class.

81
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,900
In this case, we want to upend the class of hold.

82
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,940
We still want it to have the class of Phil.

83
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,650
So plus equal will append and then we just want to put space and then hold.

84
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:47,730
All right.

85
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:53,460
As soon as I do that, when I grab this, you'll see it has the the border around it, both the one

86
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,080
I'm holding and that image.

87
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,340
Now, as soon as I pull it out of the box, I want the box to clear up.

88
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,850
So what I'll do is I will say this class name and we want to just reassign it.

89
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,060
We can leave it empty or we can just put a class of invisible.

90
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,540
I know we don't have many styles for that, but we can set it to invisible.

91
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:21,150
And but if I go over here and I click, what happens is I don't even have time to grab it and to add

92
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,990
hold it just this happens like at the same time and invisible gets applied fact.

93
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,760
If I look down here, you see that has a class of invisible.

94
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,220
Phil is gone, hold is gone.

95
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,130
If I do it real quick, it's just open this up so you can see it has a class of fill.

96
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:48,150
And as soon as I click, I don't have any time to to basically grab it so we can just add a set time

97
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,750
out which takes in a function.

98
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,690
And what I want to add is this right here

99
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,980
and we can even put zero.

100
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,380
We don't have to put anything above zero here.

101
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,230
It'll just make it so that this happens first.

102
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,550
Right.

103
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,990
So if I go over here now, I can grab it and pull it out, OK?

104
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,150
And then that box then turns white.

105
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,860
Now, as far as our event listeners down here are functions, I'm going to start with drag start.

106
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,660
I'm going to get rid of this.

107
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:28,170
And I want to add the class name of hold when we start to drag and that whole class will put that border

108
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,490
on the fill.

109
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,070
Did for the div that has the background image.

110
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:38,340
Now we can use the this keyword, which is going to pertain to whichever element that the events fired

111
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,150
on in this case it's going to be fill, which is the div with the background image.

112
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,920
So I want to take that specific element and I want to add class name.

113
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,190
Now, this class name will just set the class.

114
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,510
I could set it equal to something which would replace any other class that's already there.

115
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,930
But I actually don't want to replace, I want to append.

116
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,340
So I'm going to say plus equals and then add space hold.

117
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:08,010
OK, so it's going to still have the fill class, but it will also have the old class.

118
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:12,030
So now let's go ahead and drag this and hold.

119
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,900
And you can see the border, the c the the gray border around the picture.

120
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,860
It's kind of faint because of the picture, but it's on this one and it's on the one that's still there.

121
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,040
Now, another thing I want to do is when I pull it off the box, I want this box to go white.

122
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,320
So we want to do that by getting rid of the fill class on that.

123
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:40,170
So let's say this dot class name and we could set it to nothing, but I'm going to set it to a class

124
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:40,920
of invisible.

125
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,440
It doesn't this class doesn't do any thing.

126
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,920
There's no styling for it, but it'll get rid of the whole class.

127
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:55,110
So if I open up my tools down here so you can see it has a class of fill now, as soon as I click,

128
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,640
it goes to invisible.

129
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,110
It doesn't even give me time to to drag it and to add the class of hold.

130
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:08,250
So what we'll do is add a set timeout, which just, you know, sets a time out for something to happen,

131
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,360
for a function to run.

132
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,650
So we want to add in a function here, our function, and I want this to run in here.

133
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,690
And I don't even have to put a time.

134
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,210
I can just put zero here and that well, that's enough for this to happen first so that it just doesn't

135
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,700
disappear when I click on it.

136
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:32,220
So now if I save, I'll go ahead and click and hold and I'm able to pull it out and then this goes white.

137
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,260
OK, so we have that done.

138
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,220
Now, when I draw up, it's just it's still gone because it has the class of invisible.

139
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,470
So we also have drag and on the fill element.

140
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,430
So if we go down actually drag and is right here, we want to then add the class name of Phil.

141
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,070
So let's say this dot class name and just set that to fill.

142
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,230
Because right now we're only dealing with the one we're clicking and dragging, we're only dealing with

143
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:06,530
this because those both of those have dragged start and drag end.

144
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,920
So right now, if I pull it off, you'll see this goes white.

145
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:17,180
I'm able to add the whole class when I let go, it goes back to the same place because this specific

146
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,870
element still it still has the fill, right.

147
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,220
This this isn't being added anywhere else.

148
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,610
What we want to happen is when we drop on one of these boxes, we want this div to go in, whichever

149
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,530
one we drop.

150
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,110
So we just close access.

151
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:39,500
So what we'll do is go down to drag drop and let's get rid of this.

152
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,890
And I want to say this dot class name set that to empty.

153
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:52,840
We always want to make sure that it has a class of empty right before we drop or when we drop it.

154
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:59,240
Then we also want to add the class or not the class, but the element of fill inside of whichever one,

155
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,590
you know, we drop on.

156
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,540
And we do that with the append method.

157
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,210
So I can say this, meaning the class of empty that did with the class of empty.

158
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,760
And then I want to append into that the fill of element.

159
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,360
Now, if I save this and I try to drop it here, you notice it's not working.

160
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,090
And the reason for that, I'm just going to bring this browser window over for a second.

161
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,500
So both the drag over and the drag enter events have a default action.

162
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:32,690
You can see drag over resets the current drag operation to none, which we don't want to happen.

163
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,540
Drag enter will reject the immediate user selection as the potential target element.

164
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,000
So we don't want either of those to happen.

165
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,350
So all we have to do is for drag over and drag enter is past in our event objects and call each dot

166
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,900
prevent default.

167
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,860
That'll stop the default behavior of these two events.

168
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,380
Just like if you submit a form and you don't want to actually submit it's am doing, you don't want

169
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,450
to actually submit it to the page.

170
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,620
You want to, you know, use JavaScript, you would prevent the default behavior.

171
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,710
So now let's go ahead and try it.

172
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:15,110
So I'll just go down here and let go and notice I'm able to now drop it wherever I want.

173
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,040
OK, so that's the drag and drop functionality.

174
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,460
But I also want to have an effect when I hover over these as well to make the the box I'm hovering over

175
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,060
docker.

176
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,250
So on drag enter.

177
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:35,900
After we prevent the default, we're going to take that element and we want to append the class name.

178
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:41,240
So plus I want to do plus equals and we want to add the class of covered.

179
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,830
So now if I take this, you can see every time I enter it adds that class.

180
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,610
So we actually want to clear that when we leave.

181
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:56,540
So on drag leave, we'll just go ahead and set the class name, we'll set it equals we don't want to

182
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,630
append, we just want to basically reset it.

183
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,060
So we'll set it to empty again.

184
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,460
So now if I go over here and I enter, it gets that dark background.

185
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,860
That's the class of hover, also the dashboard here.

186
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,350
But when I leave, it goes back to empty.

187
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,090
OK, so whatever I hover over, we get that effect and then I can drop it.

188
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:22,730
All right.

189
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:30,050
So, I mean, that's that's pretty much the basics of drag and drop with HTML, HTML5 and JavaScript.

190
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:36,650
So I mean, you can be more creative with this and you can create games and really cool interfaces.

191
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:42,050
But this should give you an idea of just how to you know, how to add these different events and do

192
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,120
certain things when they fire off.

193
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,000
So that's it.

194
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,830
Thanks for watching.

195
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,270
I'll see you in the next project.
