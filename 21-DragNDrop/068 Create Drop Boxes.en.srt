1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,290
All right, so we're going to get started on a drag and drop project, so I have my project starter

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:04,850
open.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,370
I'm going to just change this to drag and drop.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,240
And the HTML is going to be really, really simple.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,020
We're basically just going to have a bunch of boxes with the class of empty.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,330
So let's say class empty and we want five of these.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,130
So we'll say times five.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,530
And the first one here, I want to have the the image that we can drag and drop.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,100
So inside this div, I'm going to have a class of fill.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:38,780
And we also want to add an attribute here of Dragonball, OK, because we want this to be Dragonball

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,600
within the browser.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,360
So we want to set Dragonball equal to true.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,130
And that's it.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,110
That's all we need for our HTML.

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,550
So now let's jump into our stylesheet and we'll start to create this.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,630
So we actually don't need any font because there's no text.

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,230
So we're just going to get rid of that for the flex direction.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,120
I'm not going to use a column unless it's on smaller screen.

19
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:08,460
So what I'll do is get rid of the Flex Direction column, but just create a media query down here.

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:20,220
So say if it's a max width of 800 pixels, so if it's under 800 pixels, then on the body, we want

21
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,850
the flex direction to be a column.

22
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,760
OK, and then in the body, the only other thing I'm going to do here is add a background color of steel

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,220
blue.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,620
All right.

25
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,840
So now we want to style the boxes with the class of empty.

26
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,430
So let's say class empty.

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,130
And I'm going to actually we don't need a display here.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:58,200
Let's do a height of 150 pixels and a width of 150 pixels and we'll do a margin of 10 pixels.

29
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,070
And I'm going to have a border solid three pixels and.

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:16,400
Black, and let's give it a background of white, OK, so there's our boxes, those are empty boxes.

31
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,070
Now, when we when we have our image here, actually, let's just do the fill class.

32
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,110
So under empty, we'll have our fill class and we're going to have a background image here.

33
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,590
And I'm going to use an unspoiled random image.

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,820
So it'll be a different image every time.

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:47,570
So for the Earth, it's a mess and it's going to be source dot on splash dot com and then slash random

36
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,830
and then you can do a size.

37
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,560
So I'm going to do one 50 x 150 will be 150 by 150.

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,060
I'm going to set the height of that to one forty five pixels.

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,180
And let's set up from a semicolon.

40
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:12,240
And let's set the width to one forty five pixels and let's look the cursor to a pointer, and if I save

41
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,590
that, you'll see we have a random image and it's going to be a different image every time.

42
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:24,360
And I'm able to drag this and see that if I don't have this, if I set this to false.

43
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,490
And now you see, I can't actually pick it up and drag it, so you want to make sure that that attribute

44
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,010
is always set to true if you're using drag and drop.

45
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,380
Now, we want to have some specific styles when we're dragging it.

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,920
So, for instance, when I'm when I click and I hold and I'm dragging it, I want it to have a border

47
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,530
like a grayish white border around it.

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:58,730
So I'm going to have a class here of hold and I'll say border so that the solid let's do five pixels

49
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,040
C.C.C..

50
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,420
Now, that's not going to be applied.

51
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,640
But when we get to our JavaScript, when we have that event where we're holding it, we wanted to add

52
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,210
the border.

53
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,800
I can add it manually.

54
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,680
If I go over here and I say hold now you can see there's that gray border around it, but I only want

55
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,780
it when I'm actually holding it.

56
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,010
And then I also want to style these boxes if we hover over.

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,070
So if I take this and I hover over a box, I want it to have a dark background and also have a dashboard

58
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,750
around it.

59
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,770
So let's have a class called Harvard.

60
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,890
So you just need to figure out the styles of the different states of the drag events, because there's

61
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,250
there's multiple drag events that we can use.

62
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,290
So we're going to set the background color of this to three, three, three, if it if it has the class

63
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:56,420
of Harvard and let's also say border color, we'll set that to white and we'll set the border style.

64
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,840
We'll set that to dashed

65
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,730
hopes.

66
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,020
Keep forgetting my semicolons border white.

67
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,000
You don't need that.

68
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:15,660
OK, so this isn't going to show just yet because we need to apply that with the JavaScript, so in

69
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,810
the next video jumped, it will jump into our script.

70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,330
Yes.

71
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,560
And we'll start to add all of our different drag events.
