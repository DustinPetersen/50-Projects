1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,130
All right, so let's get started with our button ripple effect.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,680
So the idea is we want to have a button and then we click on it.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,320
We're going to basically have our JavaScript create a specific span that will have a class of circle.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,590
And we're going to style that to basically be like a round white circle with an animation.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,360
So it scales up and we want to set the the position of it.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,350
So the top and left position, we want to set to where we click.

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,820
So we don't want to just always ripple in the center.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,350
We want it to ripple wherever we click.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,290
So we're going to have to do that within, you know, with a combination of CSR and JavaScript.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,910
So let's call this button ripple effect.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,820
And all we're going to have here is a button, we'll say click me, and then for now, I'm going to

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,260
hard code the span in here just so that we can style it.

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,790
But ultimately, like I said, this will come from JavaScript, so this will have a class of circle.

14
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,340
Then I'm going to just put some inline style in here for the position of it, so for this will just

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:16,100
say top, I'll say twenty seven pixel semicolon and then from the left, I'll do like 82 pixels.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,810
OK, so we just have our button, and that's all we need for the HTML, very, very simple.

17
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,260
Stylesheet is is pretty easy as well.

18
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:32,910
I'm going to add a background comes out of background color of black.

19
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:43,000
And then let's see that that's fine for the body, we can leave those styles and then button what style

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,110
that I'm going to give it a background color of purple and let's give it a color of white, OK?

21
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,440
And then for the border, we'll do one pixel purple solid.

22
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:08,340
And then for the font size, let's set that to 14 pixels and make it uppercase, so text, not text,

23
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,940
uppercase, text transform, we're going to set to uppercase and let's set the letter spacing.

24
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:22,820
Set that to two pixels, not 20 pixels, two pixels, spread it apart just a little bit, and then for

25
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:32,720
padding on the button, lets to do 20 pixels top and bottom, 30 pixels left and right, and then let's

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,910
set the overflow to hidden so that nothing comes out of the button and then just margin 10 pixels on

27
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,830
the top and bottom.

28
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:49,280
So obviously you could use this, you know, you could use this in any of your websites or applications.

29
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,210
So now let's do the circle that we just hardcoded inside.

30
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,430
So we'll save button, dot, circle, and we want to position this to be absolute.

31
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:07,810
And remember, we have in here, we have the inline styles of top and left.

32
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,770
This is going to just be basically random, not random, but based on where we click.

33
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,870
And we're going to do that through the JavaScript, but we're just setting it hardcoded for now.

34
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,610
So position absolute.

35
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,790
Let's give it a background color of white.

36
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,910
And of course, we could change some of these values to make it look a little different.

37
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:34,640
We'll give it a whiff of 100 pixels and also a height of 100 pixels.

38
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,560
And the reason that it's up there right now is because I positioned it.

39
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,190
Absolutely.

40
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,390
But I forgot to position the button relative.

41
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:48,100
So right now it's being positioned absolute in the browser window instead of the button.

42
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,260
So let's just add here position.

43
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,160
We want to do position relative.

44
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,370
So now it's going to be relative to the button.

45
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,390
So basically this is put wherever we you know, wherever we put this here.

46
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,320
If I if I say top zero, that's going to move it up.

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,100
So it's just a random position.

48
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:13,490
And then let's see, we want to we want it to be a circle.

49
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:19,400
So so at the border radius to 50 percent and then.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,380
It's on the on the X and Y axis, so translate, I'm sorry, transform.

51
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,230
Translated, We want to position this to be basically in the middle of where we put that point.

52
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:44,730
So to do that, let's do negative 50 percent and negative 50 percent on the X and Y axis.

53
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,450
OK, so now you can see where it's positioned.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,590
Let's see, what else do we want to do here?

55
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,220
That's pretty much it for the styling.

56
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,140
Oh, one thing I want to do is take that focus or take that outline off the focus of the button.

57
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:09,300
So button, when it's in its focus, they set the outline to.

58
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:19,010
Right now, this we want this to have an animation where it scales up and disappears.

59
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,730
So let's start this off.

60
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,850
With a scale, so I'm adding another transform value, we already have translate, but we can add more

61
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,390
than one transform value.

62
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:39,690
I want to start this off with a scale of zero, and then we're going to have an animation called Scale

63
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,640
and it will last point five seconds for the duration and we'll use these out.

64
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,570
OK, now the animation, we need to create that, so let's say keyframes.

65
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:02,470
And we called it scale, and we're just going to use a two here because we want it to go from its original

66
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,660
scale of zero and we want to change the trend.

67
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,540
Actually, I'm just going to copy this.

68
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,470
And paste that in, and we wanted to scale up to three.

69
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:20,860
You can see when I save with live servery, you can see the animation now that that's, you know, it

70
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,400
just takes up the entire thing.

71
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,000
We also want it to disappear within that time.

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,410
So we'll set the capacity to zero.

73
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,600
So now you can see as it scales up, it just disappears.

74
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,190
OK, or it has that has that fading out effect, really.

75
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,520
So that's pretty much it for for the success and the next video, we're going to make it so that when

76
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:49,050
we click, we want to target where we click and then have that effect come from, you know, wherever

77
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,620
we click.
