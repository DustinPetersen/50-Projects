00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,010
So in this project, we're going to create a button ripple effect, basically will be able to have buttons

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,710
and just give it a specific class of ripple.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,150
And when we do that, if we click on those buttons, we'll get this effect.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,190
And it's not just a ripple effect in the center.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,080
It's wherever we click on the button.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,490
And we're going to obviously add the animation, the styling with access.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,340
But we need JavaScript to be able to pinpoint where exactly we're clicking so that we can change some

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,620
of the CSFs values of the positioning to give it that effect in that exact position.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,250
All right.

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,200
So that's what we'll be doing.

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,700
Let's go ahead and get started.
